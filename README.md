# `luno` - Linearized Uncertainty for Neural Operators

This repository contains the main algorithm of the paper "Linearization Turns Neural Operators into Function-Valued Gaussian Processes" by Magnani et al. (2025).

## Description

`luno` is a Python package that implements linearized uncertainty quantification for neural operators. It provides tools for:
- Fourier Neural Operators with uncertainty quantification
- Jacobian computations for Fourier Neural Operators
- Covariance structures for function-valued Gaussian processes

## Installation

The package can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/MethodsOfMachineLearning/luno.git
```

For development installation with all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
